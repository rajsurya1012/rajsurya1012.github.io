I am a passionate roboticist with a keen interest in perception and planning for robots. Being a quick learner, I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments that push my boundaries and help me enhance my skills.

My experience with various autonomous robots, including SPOT, mini drones, manipulators, and both outdoor and indoor AMRs, has deepened my appreciation for the value robots bring and increased my enthusiasm for robotic development. The new advancements in the field of robotics continually motivate me to become a better roboticist and aspire for greater knowledge.

Beyond robots, I enjoy competitive programming, playing different sports, watching documentaries, and listening to music.

If you enjoy board games, I have created a simple AI agent that can challenge you in an ancient Indian game from my birthplace â€” <a href="https://github.com/rajsurya1012/aadupuliyattam">Aadupuliyattam (A game of goats and tigers)</a> .
